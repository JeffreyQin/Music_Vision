# Music Vision

A Convolutional Neural Network trained 100% on original data to locate and identify note sequences from sheet music images into a computer readable format.

Model Pipeline: Python (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, Matplotlib)
Labelling Software: JavaScript (express.js), HTML


## Using the Labelling Software

1. Store your raw data (sheet music images) in 'music_score/raw_images/', renaming image files is not needed.
2. Run '''cd label_software/''', then '''npm install''', then '''node app.js''' in the terminal to start backend services.
3. Open index.html with "live server" or equivalent
